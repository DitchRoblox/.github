### About

DitchRoblox was the name of a much older and now retired project by connor33341. It was designed to read .rbxm binaries produced by roblox and port the games 3D files to various game engines. Such as connor33341's own engine RT3DGE which is still in development.

Now DitchRoblox, founded by connor33341, is working to create a way to port existing roblox games to custom or even well known engines.
